# Car Dekho Dashboard ðŸš—
## Project Overview ðŸ“Š
This analysis creates a dashboard to quantify and visualize used car sales performance and valuation drivers. The primary goal is to establish transparent pricing metrics for sellers and buyers by breaking down sales data across key dimensions like car specifications, demographics, and geography. Key metrics tracked include Average Selling Price (ASP), Total Transaction Volume, and Inventory Turnover Rate.


## Key Insights ðŸ’¡
Depreciation is Driven by Use: The two most critical factors determining a used car's value are its Age (Year of Manufacture) and the Kilometers Driven (Mileage). Newer cars with less mileage command a significantly higher resale price.

Maruti and Hyundai Dominate Value: Mass-market brands like Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai lead the market in both sales volume and resale value, mainly due to their reputation for low maintenance costs and high fuel efficiency.

The Market is Shifting to SUVs: While compact hatchbacks remain the highest-selling body style, there is a distinct and rapid surge in demand for SUVs. This shift is causing the average selling price of used cars to rise overall as buyers prioritize larger, feature-rich vehicles.

Digitalization and Trust are Key: The growth of organized players and online platforms has led to increased market transparency, making it easier for buyers to trust and purchase certified pre-owned vehicles.


## Conclusion âœ…
The dashboard successfully identifies Vehicle Age and Kilometers Driven as the strongest indicators of resale price. While the market is dominated by mass-segment, high-mileage brands like Maruti and Hyundai due to their low maintenance and better resale value, the emerging trend toward SUVs and premium, well-maintained vehicles indicates a maturing consumer base willing to pay a higher average selling price (which has risen by about 25.8% recently).


## Recommendations ðŸŽ¯
Optimize Inventory Acquisition: Focus acquisition efforts on newer, low-mileage vehicles (under 5 years old and under 40,000 km) to meet the strong current demand from urban buyers.

Strategic Pricing: Utilize the models developed from this data (e.g., regression models) to implement dynamic pricing strategies, ensuring that the price is set optimally based on the vehicle's features, mileage, and current market demand to maximize gross profit per vehicle.

Targeted Marketing: Direct marketing efforts in key states (Maharashtra, Delhi) and segments (Hatchbacks and entry-level SUVs) which show the highest transaction volume.

Enhance Trust: Continue to emphasize certified pre-owned cars and comprehensive vehicle history reports to capitalize on the growing consumer trust in the organized used car sector.
